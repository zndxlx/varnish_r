<span id="phk-ssl-again"></span><h1>SSL revisited<a class="headerlink" href="#ssl-revisited" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Four years ago, I wrote a rant about why Varnish has no SSL support
(<a class="reference internal" href="ssl.html#phk-ssl"><em>Why no SSL ?</em></a>) and the upcoming 4.1 release is good excuse to
revisit that issue.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-ssl-tls-library">
<h2>A SSL/TLS library<a class="headerlink" href="#a-ssl-tls-library" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In 2011 I criticized OpenSSL's source-code as being a nightmare,
and as much as I Hate To Say I Told You So, I Told You So:  See also
&quot;HeartBleed&quot;.</p>
<p>The good news is that HeartBleed made people realize that FOSS
maintainers also have mortgages and hungry kids.</p>
<p>Various initiatives have been launched to make prevent critical
infrastructure software from being maintained Sunday evening between
11 and 12PM by a sleep-deprived and overworked parent, worried about
about being able to pay the bills come the next month.</p>
<p>We're not there yet, but it's certainly getting better.</p>
<p>However, implementing TLS and SSL is still insanely complex, and
thanks to Edward Snowdens whistle-blowing, we have very good reasons
to believe that didn't happen by accident.</p>
<p>The issue of finding a good TLS/SSL implementation is still the
same and I still don't see one I would want my name associated with.</p>
<p>OpenBSD's LibreSSL is certainly a step in a right direction, but
time will show if it is viable in the long run -- they do have
a tendency to be -- &quot;SQUIRREL!!&quot; -- distracted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="handling-certificates">
<h2>Handling Certificates<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-certificates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I still don't see a way to do that.  The Varnish worker-process is not
built to compartmentalize bits at a cryptographic level and making it
do that would be a non-trivial undertaking.</p>
<p>But there is new loop-hole here.
One night, waiting for my flight home in Oslo airport, I went though
the entire TLS/SSL handshake process to see if there were anything
one could do, and I realized that you can actually terminate TLS/SSL
without holding the certificate, provided you can ask some process
which does to do a tiny bit of work.</p>
<p>The next morning <a class="reference external" href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/keyless-ssl-the-nitty-gritty-technical-details/">CloudFlare announced the very same thing</a>:</p>
<p>This could conceivably be a way to terminate TLS/SSL in the Varnish-worker
process, while keeping the most valuable crypto-bits away from it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="but-it-s-still-a-bad-idea">
<h2>But it's still a bad idea<a class="headerlink" href="#but-it-s-still-a-bad-idea" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As I write this, the news that <a class="reference external" href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/04/27/android-apps-still-suffer-game-over-https-defects-7-months-later/">apps with 350 million downloads</a> in total
are (still) vulnerable to some SSL/TLS Man-In-The-Middle attack is doing the
rounds.</p>
<p>Code is hard, crypto code is double-plus-hard, if not double-squared-hard,
and the world really don't need another piece of code that does an
half-assed job at cryptography.</p>
<p>If I, or somebody else, were to implement SSL/TLS in Varnish, it would
talk at least half a year to bring the code to a point where I would be
willing to show it to the world.</p>
<p>Until I get my time-machine working, that half year would be taken
away of other Varnish development, so the result had better be worth
it: If it isn't, we have just increased the total attack-surface
and bug-probability for no better reason than &quot;me too!&quot;.</p>
<p>When I look at something like Willy Tarreau's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a> I have a
hard time to see any significant opportunity for improvement.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>No, Varnish still won't add SSL/TLS support.</p>
<p>Instead in Varnish 4.1 we have added support for Willys <a class="reference external" href="http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt">PROXY</a>
protocol which makes it possible to communicate the extra details
from a SSL-terminating proxy, such as <a class="reference external" href="http://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a>, to Varnish.</p>
<p>From a security point of view, this is also much better solution
than having SSL/TLS integrated in Varnish.</p>
<p>When (not if!) the SSL/TLS proxy you picked is compromised by a
possibly planted software bug, you can pick another one to replace
it, without loosing all the benefits of Varnish.</p>
<p>That idea is called the &quot;Software Tools Principle&quot;, it's a very old
idea, but it is still one of the best we have.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="political-postscript">
<h2>Political PostScript<a class="headerlink" href="#political-postscript" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I realize that the above is a pretty strange stance to take in the
current &quot;SSL Everywhere&quot; political climate.</p>
<p>I'm not too thrilled about the &quot;SSL Everywhere&quot; idea, for a large
number of reasons.</p>
<p>The most obvious example is that you don't want to bog down your
country's civil defence agency with SSL/TLS protocol negotiations,
if their website is being deluged by people trying to survive a
natural disaster.</p>
<p>The next big issue is that there are people who do not have a right
to privacy.  In many countries this includes children, prisoners,
stock-traders, flight-controllers, first responders and so on.</p>
<p>SSL Everywhere will force institutions to either block any internet
connectivity or impose Man-in-The-Middle proxies to comply with
legal requirements of logging and inspection.  A clear step in
the wrong direction in my view.</p>
<p>But one of the biggest problem I have with SSL Everywhere is that
it gives privacy to the actors I think deserve it the least.</p>
<p>Again and again shady behaviour of big transnational, and therefore
law-less, companies have been exposed by security researchers (or
just interested lay-people) who ran tcpdump. snort or similar traffic
capture programs and saw what went on.</p>
<p>Remember all the different kind of &quot;magic cookies&quot; used to track
users across the web, against their wish and against laws and regulations ?</p>
<p>Pretty much all of those were exposed with trivial packet traces.</p>
<p>With SSL Everywhere, these actors get much more privacy to invade
the privacy of every human being with an internet connection, because
it takes a lot more skill to look into a SSL connection than a
plaintext HTTP connection.</p>
<p>&quot;Sunshine is said to be the best of disinfectants&quot; wrote supreme
court justice Brandeis, SSL Everywhere puts all traffic in the shade.</p>
