------------------------------
Varnish Configuration Language
------------------------------

:Manual section: 7

DESCRIPTION
===========

The VCL language is a small domain-specific language designed to be
used to describe request handling and document caching policies for
Varnish Cache.

When a new configuration is loaded, the varnishd management process
translates the VCL code to C and compiles it to a shared object which
is then loaded into the server process.

This document focuses on the syntax of the VCL language. For a full
description of syntax and semantics, with ample examples, please see
the online documentation at https://www.varnish-cache.org/docs/ .

Starting with Varnish 4.0, each VCL file must start by declaring its
version with ``vcl`` *<major>.<minor>*\ ``;`` marker at the top of
the file.  See more about this under Versioning below.


Operators
---------

The following operators are available in VCL:

  ``=``
    Assignment operator.

  ``==``
    Comparison.

  ``~``
    Match. Can either be used with regular expressions or ACLs.

  ``!``
    Negation.

  ``&&``
    Logical and.

  ``||``
    Logical or.


Conditionals
------------

VCL has ``if`` and ``else`` statements. Nested logic can be
implemented with the ``elseif`` statement (``elsif``\ /\ ``elif``\ /\
``else if`` are equivalent).

Note that there are no loops or iterators of any kind in VCL.


Strings, booleans, time, duration, integers and real numbers
------------------------------------------------------------

These are the data types in Varnish. You can ``set`` or ``unset`` these.

Example::

  set req.http.User-Agent = "unknown";
  unset req.http.Range;


Strings
~~~~~~~

Basic strings are enclosed in double quotes ``"``\ *...*\ ``"``, and
may not contain newlines. Long strings are enclosed in
``{"``\ *...*\ ``"}``. They may contain any character including single
double quotes ``"``, newline and other control characters except for the
*NUL* (0x00) character.

Booleans
~~~~~~~~

Booleans can be either ``true`` or ``false``.  In addition, in a boolean
context some data types will evaluate to ``true`` or ``false`` depending on
their value.

String types will evaluate to ``false`` if they are empty; backend types
will evalute to ``false`` if they don't have a backend assigned; integer
types will evaluate to ``false`` if their value is zero; duration types
will evaluate to ``false`` if their value is equal or less than zero.

Time
~~~~

VCL has time. A duration can be added to a time to make another time.
In string context they return a formatted string in RFC1123 format,
e.g. ``Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT``.

The keyword ``now`` returns a time representing the current time in seconds
since the Epoch.

Durations
~~~~~~~~~

Durations are defined by a number followed by a unit. The number can
include a fractional part, e.g. ``1.5s``. The supported units are:

  ``ms``
    milliseconds

  ``s``
    seconds

  ``m``
    minutes

  ``h``
    hours

  ``d``
    days

  ``w``
    weeks

  ``y``
    years

Integers
~~~~~~~~

Certain fields are integers, used as expected. In string context they
return a string.

Real numbers
~~~~~~~~~~~~

VCL understands real numbers. As with integers, when used in a string
context they will return a string.


Regular Expressions
-------------------

Varnish uses Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE). For a
complete description please see the pcre(3) man page.

To send flags to the PCRE engine, such as to do case insensitive matching, add
the flag within parens following a question mark, like this::

    # If host is NOT example dot com..
    if (req.http.host !~ "(?i)example.com$") {
        ...
    }


Include statement
-----------------

To include a VCL file in another file use the include keyword::

    include "foo.vcl";


Import statement
----------------

The ``import`` statement is used to load Varnish Modules (VMODs.)

Example::

    import std;
    sub vcl_recv {
        std.log("foo");
    }

Comments
--------

Single lines of VCL can be commented out using ``//`` or
``#``. Multi-line blocks can be commented out with
``/*``\ *block*\ ``*/``.

Example::

    sub vcl_recv {
        // Single line of out-commented VCL.
        # Another way of commenting out a single line.
        /*
            Multi-line block of commented-out VCL.
        */
    }


Backend definition
------------------

A backend declaration creates and initialises a named backend object. A
declaration start with the keyword ``backend`` followed by the name of the
backend. The actual declaration is in curly brackets, in a key/value fashion.::

    backend name {
        .attribute = "value";
    }

The only mandatory attribute is ``.host``. The attributes will inherit
their defaults from the global parameters. The following attributes
are available:

  ``.host`` *(mandatory)*
    The host to be used. IP address or a hostname that resolves to a
    single IP address.

  ``.port``
    The port on the backend that Varnish should connect to.

  ``.host_header``
    A host header to add to probes and regular backend requests if they have no
    such header.

  ``.connect_timeout``
    Timeout for connections.

  ``.first_byte_timeout``
    Timeout for first byte.

  ``.between_bytes_timeout``
    Timeout between bytes.

  ``.probe``
    Attach a probe to the backend. See `Probes`_

  ``.proxy_header``
    The PROXY protocol version Varnish should use when connecting to
    this backend. Allowed values are ``1`` and ``2``.

  ``.max_connections``
    Maximum number of open connections towards this backend. If
    Varnish reaches the maximum Varnish it will start failing
    connections.

Backends can be used with *directors*. Please see the
:ref:`vmod_directors(3)` man page for more information.

.. _reference-vcl_probes:

Probes
------

Probes will query the backend for status on a regular basis and mark
the backend as down it they fail. A probe is defined as this::

    probe name {
        .attribute = "value";
    }

The probe named ``default`` is special and will be used for all backends
which do not explicitly reference a probe.

There are no mandatory options. These are the options you can set:

  ``.url``
    The URL to query. Defaults to ``/``.

  ``.request``
    Specify a full HTTP request using multiple strings. ``.request`` will
    have ``\r\n`` automatically inserted after every string. If
    specified, ``.request`` will take precedence over ``.url``.

  ``.expected_response``
    The expected HTTP response code. Defaults to ``200``.

  ``.timeout``
    The timeout for the probe. Default is ``2s``.

  ``.interval``
    How often the probe is run. Default is ``5s``.

  ``.initial``
    How many of the polls in ``.window`` are considered good when Varnish
    starts. Defaults to the value of ``.threshold`` - 1. In this case, the
    backend starts as sick and requires one single poll to be
    considered healthy.

  ``.window``
    How many of the latest polls we examine to determine backend health.
    Defaults to ``8``.

  ``.threshold``
    How many of the polls in .window must have succeeded for us to
    consider the backend healthy. Defaults to ``3``.


Access Control List (ACL)
-------------------------

An Access Control List (ACL) declaration creates and initialises a named access
control list which can later be used to match client addresses::

    acl localnetwork {
        "localhost";    # myself
        "192.0.2.0"/24; # and everyone on the local network
        ! "192.0.2.23"; # except for the dial-in router
    }

If an ACL entry specifies a host name which Varnish is unable to
resolve, it will match any address it is compared to. Consequently,
if it is preceded by a negation mark, it will reject any address it is
compared to, which may not be what you intended. If the entry is
enclosed in parentheses, however, it will simply be ignored.

To match an IP address against an ACL, simply use the match operator::

    if (client.ip ~ localnetwork) {
        return (pipe);
    }


VCL objects
-----------

A VCL object can be instantiated with the ``new`` keyword::

    sub vcl_init {
        new b = directors.round_robin()
        b.add_backend(node1);
    }

This is only available in ``vcl_init``.

Subroutines
-----------

A subroutine is used to group code for legibility or reusability::

    sub pipe_if_local {
        if (client.ip ~ localnetwork) {
            return (pipe);
        }
    }

Subroutines in VCL do not take arguments, nor do they return
values. The built in subroutines all have names beginning with ``vcl_``,
which is reserved.

To call a subroutine, use the ``call`` keyword followed by the
subroutine's name::

    sub vcl_recv {
        call pipe_if_local;
    }

Return statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ongoing ``vcl_*`` subroutine execution ends when a
``return(``\ *<action>*\ ``)`` statement is made.

The *<action>* specifies how execution should proceed. The context
defines which actions are available.

Multiple subroutines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If multiple subroutines with the name of one of the built-in ones are defined,
they are concatenated in the order in which they appear in the source.

The built-in VCL distributed with Varnish will be implicitly concatenated
when the VCL is compiled.


Variables
---------

In VCL you have access to certain variable objects. These contain
requests and responses currently being worked on. What variables are
available depends on context.

.. include:: ../include/vcl_var.rst


Functions
---------

The following built-in functions are available:

.. _vcl(7)_ban:

ban(STRING)
~~~~~~~~~~~

  Invalidates all objects in cache that match the given expression with the
  ban mechanism.

  The format of *STRING* is::

	<field> <operator> <arg> [&& <field> <oper> <arg> ...]

  * *<field>*:

    * ``req.url``: The request url
    * ``req.http.*``: Any request header
    * ``obj.status``: The cache object status
    * ``obj.http.*``: Any cache object header

  * *<operator>*:

    * ``==``: *<field>* and *<arg>* are equal strings (case sensitive)
    * ``!=``: *<field>* and *<arg>* are unequal strings (case sensitive)
    * ``~``: *<field>* matches the regular expression *<arg>*
    * ``!~``:*<field>* does not match the regular expression *<arg>*

  * *<arg>*: Either a literal string or a regular expression. Note
    that *<arg>* does not use any of the string delimiters like ``"``
    or ``{"``\ *...*\ ``"}`` used elsewhere in varnish. To match
    against strings containing whitespace, regular expressions
    containing ``\s`` can be used.

  Expressions can be chained using the *and* operator ``&&``. For *or*
  semantics, use several bans.

hash_data(input)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Adds an input to the hash input. In the built-in VCL ``hash_data()``
  is called on the host and URL of the request. Available in ``vcl_hash``.

synthetic(STRING)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Prepare a synthetic response body containing the *STRING*. Available in
  ``vcl_synth`` and ``vcl_backend_error``.

.. list above comes from struct action_table[] in vcc_action.c.

regsub(str, regex, sub)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Returns a copy of *str* with the first occurrence of the regular
  expression *regex* replaced with *sub*. Within *sub*, ``\0`` (which
  can also be spelled ``\&``) is replaced with the entire matched
  string, and ``\``\ *n* is replaced with the contents of subgroup *n*
  in the matched string.

regsuball(str, regex, sub)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  As ``regsub()``, but this replaces all occurrences.

.. regsub* is in vcc_expr.c

For converting or casting VCL values between data types use the functions
available in the std VMOD.

Versioning
==========

Multiple versions of the VCL syntax can coexist within certain
constraints.

The VCL syntax version at the start of VCL file specified with ``-f``
sets the hard limit that cannot be exceeded anywhere, and it selects
the appropriate version of the builtin VCL.

That means that you can never include ``vcl 9.1;`` from ``vcl 8.7;``,
but the opposite *may* be possible, to the extent the compiler
supports it.

Files pulled in via ``include`` do not need to have a
``vcl`` *X.Y*\ ``;`` but it may be a good idea to do it anyway, to
not have surprises in the future.  The syntax version set in an
included file only applies to that file and any files it includes -
unless these set their own VCL syntax version.

The version of Varnish this file belongs to supports syntax 4.0 only.
