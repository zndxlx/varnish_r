.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
import directors [from "path"] ;
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fIvmod_directors\fP enables backend load balancing in Varnish.
.sp
The module implements load balancing techniques, and also serves as an
example on how one could extend the load balancing capabilities of
Varnish.
.sp
To enable load balancing you must import this vmod (directors).
.sp
Then you define your backends. Once you have the backends declared you
can add them to a director. This happens in executed VCL code. If you
want to emulate the previous behavior of Varnish 3.0 you can just
initialize the directors in vcl_init, like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
sub vcl_init {
    new vdir = directors.round_robin();
    vdir.add_backend(backend1);
    vdir.add_backend(backend2);
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As you can see there is nothing keeping you from manipulating the
directors elsewhere in VCL. So, you could have VCL code that would
add more backends to a director when a certain URL is called.
.sp
Note that directors can use other directors as backends.

backend, even if a higher\-priority backend becomes available. Once the
whole backend list is exhausted, it\(aqll start over at the beginning.

Create a shard director.

Note that the shard director needs to be configured using at least one
\fBshard.add_backend()\fP call(s) \fBfollowed by a\fP
\fBshard.reconfigure()\fP \fBcall\fP before it can hand out backends.
.SS Introduction
.sp
The shard director selects backends by a key, which can be provided
directly or derived from strings. For the same key, the shard director
will always return the same backend, unless the backend configuration
or health state changes. Conversely, for differing keys, the shard
director will likely choose different backends. In the default
configuration, unhealthy backends are not selected.
.sp
The shard director resembles the hash director, but its main advantage
is that, when the backend configuration or health states change, the
association of keys to backends remains as stable as possible.
.sp
In addition, the rampup and warmup features can help to further
improve user\-perceived response times.
.SS Sharding
.sp
This basic technique allows for numerous applications like optimizing
backend server cache efficiency, Varnish clustering or persisting
sessions to servers without keeping any state, and, in particular,
without the need to synchronize state between nodes of a cluster of
Varnish servers:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Many applications use caches for data objects, so, in a cluster of
application servers, requesting similar objects from the same server
may help to optimize efficiency of such caches.
.sp
For example, sharding by URL or some \fIid\fP component of the url has
been shown to drastically improve the efficiency of many content
management systems.
.IP \(bu 2
As special case of the previous example, in clusters of Varnish
servers without additional request distribution logic, each cache
will need store all hot objects, so the effective cache size is
approximately the smallest cache size of any server in the cluster.
.sp
Sharding allows to segregate objects within the cluster such that
each object is only cached on one of the servers (or on one primary
and one backup, on a primary for long and others for short
etc...). Effectively, this will lead to a cache size in the order of
the sum of all individual caches, with the potential to drastically
increase efficiency (scales by the number of servers).
.IP \(bu 2
Another application is to implement persistence of backend requests,
such that all requests sharing a certain criterion (such as an IP
address or session ID) get forwarded to the same backend server.
.UNINDENT
.sp
When used with clusters of varnish servers, the shard director will,
if otherwise configured equally, make the same decision on all
servers. In other words, requests sharing a common criterion used as
the shard key will be balanced onto the same backend server(s) no
matter which Varnish server handles the request.
.sp
The drawbacks are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
the distribution of requests depends on the number of requests per
key and the uniformity of the distribution of key values. In short,
while this technique may lead to much better efficiency overall, it
may also lead to less good load balancing for specific cases.
.IP \(bu 2
When a backend server becomes unavailable, every persistence
technique has to reselect a new backend server, but this technique
will also switch back to the preferred server once it becomes
healthy again, so when used for persistence, it is generally less
stable compared to stateful techniques (which would continue to use
a selected server for as long as possible (or dictated by a TTL)).
.UNINDENT
.SS Method
.sp
When \fB\&.reconfigure()\fP is called, a consistent hashing circular data
structure gets built from hash values of "ident%d" (default ident
being the backend name) for each backend and for a running number from
1 to n (n is the number of \fIreplicas\fP). Hashing creates the seemingly
random order for placement of backends on the consistent hashing ring.
.sp
When \fB\&.backend()\fP is called, a load balancing key gets generated
unless provided. The smallest hash value in the circle is looked up
that is larger than the key (searching clockwise and wrapping around
as necessary). The backend for this hash value is the preferred
backend for the given key.
.sp
If a healthy backend is requested, the search is continued linearly on
the ring as long as backends found are unhealthy or all backends have
been checked. The order of these "alternative backends" on the ring
is likely to differ for different keys. Alternative backends can also
be selected explicitly.

This documentation uses the notion of an order of backends for a
particular shard key. This order is deterministic but seemingly random
as determined by the consistent hashing algorithm and is likely to
differ for different keys, depending on the number of backends and the
number of replicas. In particular, the backend order referred to here
is _not_ the order given when backends are added.
