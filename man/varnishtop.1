.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
varnishtop [\-1] [\-b] [\-c] [\-C] [\-d] [\-f] [\-g <session|request|vxid|raw>] [\-h] [\-i <taglist>] [\-I <[taglist:]regex>] [\-L <limit>] [\-n <dir>] [\-N <filename>] [\-p <period>] [\-q <query>] [\-r <filename>] [\-t <seconds|off>] [\-T <seconds>] [\-x <taglist>] [\-X <[taglist:]regex>] [\-V]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The varnishtop utility reads \fIvarnishd(1)\fP shared memory logs and
presents a continuously updated list of the most commonly occurring
log entries.  With suitable filtering using the \fB\-I\fP, \fB\-i\fP, \fB\-X\fP
and \fB\-x\fP options, it can be used to display a ranking of requested
documents, clients, user agents, or any other information which is
recorded in the log.
.sp
The following options are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-1
Instead of a continuously updated display, print the statistics once and exit. Implies \fB\-d\fP\&.
.TP
.B \-b
Only display transactions and log records coming from backend communication.
.TP
.B \-c
Only display transactions and log records coming from client communication.
.TP
.B \-C
Do all regular expression and string matching caseless.
.TP
.B \-d
Process log records at the head of the log and exit.
.TP
.B \-f
Sort and group only on the first field of each log entry. This is useful when displaying e.g. stataddr entries, where the first field is the client IP address.
.TP
.BI \-g \ <session|request|vxid|raw>
The grouping of the log records. The default is to group by vxid.
.TP
.B \-h
Print program usage and exit
.TP
.BI \-i \ <taglist>
Include log records of these tags in output. Taglist is a comma\-separated list of tag globs. Multiple \-i options may be given.
.sp
If a tag include option is the first of any tag selection options, all tags are first marked excluded.
.TP
.BI \-I \ <[taglist:]regex>
Include by regex matching. Output only records matching taglist and regular expression. Applies to any tag if taglist is absent.
.sp
If a tag include option is the first of any tag selection options, all tags are first marked excluded.
.TP
.BI \-L \ <limit>
Sets the upper limit of incomplete transactions kept before the oldest transaction is force completed. A warning record is synthesized when this happens. This setting keeps an upper bound on the memory usage of running queries. Defaults to 1000 transactions.
.TP
.BI \-n \ <dir>
Specify the varnishd working directory (also known as instance name) to get logs from. If \-n is not specified, the host name is used.
.TP
.BI \-N \ <filename>
Specify the filename of a stale VSM instance. When using this option the abandonment checking is disabled.
.TP
.BI \-p \ <period>
Specified the number of seconds to measure over, the default is 60 seconds. The first number in the list is the average number of requests seen over this time period. This option has no effect if \-1 option is also used.
.TP
.BI \-q \ <query>
Specifies the VSL query to use.
.TP
.BI \-r \ <filename>
Read log in binary file format from this file. The file can be created with \fBvarnishlog \-w filename\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-t \ <seconds|off>
Timeout before returning error on initial VSM connection. If set the VSM connection is retried every 0.5 seconds for this many seconds. If zero the connection is attempted only once and will fail immediately if unsuccessful. If set to "off", the connection will not fail, allowing the utility to start and wait indefinetely for the Varnish instance to appear.  Defaults to 5 seconds.
.TP
.BI \-T \ <seconds>
Sets the transaction timeout in seconds. This defines the maximum number of seconds elapsed between a Begin tag and the End tag. If the timeout expires, a warning record is synthesized and the transaction is force completed. Defaults to 120 seconds.
.TP
.BI \-x \ <taglist>
Exclude log records of these tags in output. Taglist is a comma\-separated list of tag globs. Multiple \-x options may be given.
.TP
.BI \-X \ <[taglist:]regex>
Exclude by regex matching. Do not output records matching taglist and regular expression. Applies to any tag if taglist is absent.
.TP
.B \-V
Print version information and exit.
