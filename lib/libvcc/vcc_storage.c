 * All stuff related to the storage.* part of the namespace.
 *
 * "All" is actually only a wildcard function, which instantiates variables
 * on demand under the storage.* tree of the namespace.
 *
 * About the syntax:
 * -----------------
 *
 * One of our long term goals is to have dynamic storage configuration, such
 * as the ability to add or remove a stevedore on the fly, without restarting
 * the worker process.
 *
 * Even though this goal is far out in the future, it influences the syntax
 * design of storage selection from VCL.
 *
 * In difference from backends, where we know the possible set of backends at
 * compile time, we will not in the future know the identity of the stevedores
 * available at compile time, so we have to rely on VRT name resolution.
 *
 * This indicates a namespace on the form storage.<stevedore>.<property>
 *
 * For each property, we must define a default value if the named stevedore
 * does not exists, such that for instance stevedore.forgetit.freespace
 * returns zero etc.
 *
