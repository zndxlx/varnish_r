 *
 * On concurrency:
 *
 * There are several options for the enter method to add an fd for the waiter
 * thread to look after:
 *
 * - share the binheap (requiring a mutex) - implemented for epoll and kqueues
 *
 * - send events to be entered through the events interface and keep the binheap
 *   private to the waiter thread - implemented here.
 *
 * - some other message passing / mailbox
 *
 * It has not yet been determined which option is best. In the best case, by
 * sharing the binheap, we can save two port syscalls - but not always:
 *
 * - if the waited event has a timeout earlier than the first element on the
 *   binheap, we need to kick the waiter thread anyway
 *
 * - if the waiter thread is busy, it will get the passed waited event together
 *   with other events
 *
 * on the other end we need to sync on the mtx to protect the binheap.  Solaris
 * uses userland adaptive mutexes: if the thread holding the lock is running,
 * spinlock, otherwise syscall.
 *
 * and the critical section for the mtx is basically "whenever not blocking in
 * port_getn", which does not sound too good with respect to scalability.
 *
 * At any rate, we could save even more syscalls by increasing nevents
 * (port_getn returns when nevents exist or the timeout is reached). This would
 * increase our latency reacting on POLLIN events.
 *
