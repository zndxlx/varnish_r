 *
 * Ban processing
 *
 * A ban consists of a number of conditions (or tests), all of which must be
 * satisfied.  Here are some potential bans we could support:
 *
 *	req.url == "/foo"
 *	req.url ~ ".iso" && obj.size > 10MB
 *	req.http.host ~ "web1.com" && obj.http.set-cookie ~ "USER=29293"
 *
 * We make the "&&" mandatory from the start, leaving the syntax space
 * for latter handling of "||" as well.
 *
 * Bans are compiled into bytestrings as follows:
 *	8 bytes	- double: timestamp		XXX: Byteorder ?
 *	4 bytes - be32: length
 *	1 byte - flags: 0x01: BAN_F_{REQ|OBJ|COMPLETED}
 *	N tests
 * A test have this form:
 *	1 byte - arg (see ban_vars.h col 3 "BANS_ARG_XXX")
 *	(n bytes) - http header name, canonical encoding
 *	lump - comparison arg
 *	1 byte - operation (BANS_OPER_)
 *	(lump) - compiled regexp
 * A lump is:
 *	4 bytes - be32: length
 *	n bytes - content
 *
 * In a perfect world, we should vector through VRE to get to PCRE,
 * but since we rely on PCRE's ability to encode the regexp into a
 * byte string, that would be a little bit artificial, so this is
 * the exception that confirms the rule.
